### Programming Problem Notes

 For each programming problem, let us know:

 - How we should compile your code: 
For part 1:
 "make book.o", "make clothing.o", "make movie.o", "make util.o"
 "make product_parser.o"
For part 2: 
 "make" or "make all"

 for valgrind: valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./amazon filename


 - Any additional tests you wrote and what files those exist in
 I added a few more products to the provided database.txt file and also created
 several more files that I used to test (boren_fam.txt, boren_big_spending,
 test.cpp, trying.txt, and more_spending_boren) but ignored them using .gitignore
 as instructed
